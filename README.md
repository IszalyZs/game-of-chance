# Game of chance

In this project my task is to select a game of chance
and write a simulation to test out how we could win on it 
with the best probability.

The program uses CSV files, if you start it at first, they will be generated.
You can use it without command-line arguments and with arguments.

When run without arguments the program prints out some diagnostic information 
but at first you don’t have CSV files. 

Running with command-line arguments, which means we ask the program to generate rounds
of historical, simulated data for us. After this is done, the program uses this to 
evaluate what’s the best tactic to win in the game. 
Running the application again with another argument. The program would add new 
rounds of simulated games and reevaluate the results.  

If you use wrong arguments the program will send an error message.
